## Overview

CodeDocX addresses the critical documentation challenges in modern software development:

- **Writing**: Slow, repetitive, and often skipped
- **Reading**: Painful and time-consuming, especially for new team members

This leads to onboarding delays, wasted engineering time, and avoidable bugs due to poor documentation.
