# Enhanced Class Documentation Requirements

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the existing class documentation generation to provide comprehensive, junior-developer-friendly documentation that includes Spring-specific patterns, real codebase usage examples, and balanced content for both beginner and intermediate developers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Spring-Focused Documentation Structure

**User Story:** As a Java developer working with Spring applications, I want class documentation that explains Spring-specific patterns and annotations, so that I can understand how the class fits into the Spring ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating documentation for a Spring component THEN the system SHALL identify and explain Spring annotations (@Service, @Controller, @Repository, @Component, @RestController, @Autowired, etc.)
2. WHEN a class follows Spring patterns THEN the system SHALL explain the pattern (MVC, Dependency Injection, AOP, etc.) in simple terms
3. WHEN documenting Spring beans THEN the system SHALL explain the bean lifecycle and scope if relevant
4. IF a class is a Spring Boot configuration THEN the system SHALL explain what it configures and why

### Requirement 2: Real Codebase Usage Examples

**User Story:** As a developer learning the codebase, I want to see actual examples of how methods are used in the real code, so that I can understand practical usage patterns rather than theoretical examples.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating method documentation THEN the system SHALL search the codebase for actual method calls and usage patterns
2. WHEN real usage examples are found THEN the system SHALL include them in the documentation with proper context
3. WHEN showing method parameters THEN the system SHALL use actual parameter values found in the codebase when possible
4. IF no real usage is found THEN the system SHALL generate realistic examples based on parameter types and Spring patterns
5. WHEN multiple usage patterns exist THEN the system SHALL show the most common and representative examples

### Requirement 3: Adaptive Documentation Length

**User Story:** As a developer reading documentation, I want the documentation length to match the complexity of the class, so that simple classes have concise docs and complex classes have comprehensive explanations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting a class with 1-5 methods THEN the system SHALL generate concise documentation (200-400 words)
2. WHEN documenting a class with 6-15 methods THEN the system SHALL generate moderate documentation (400-800 words)
3. WHEN documenting a class with 16+ methods THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive documentation (800-1500 words)
4. WHEN a class has complex relationships THEN the system SHALL include additional relationship documentation regardless of method count
5. WHEN a class implements multiple interfaces or extends classes THEN the system SHALL provide additional context about inheritance

### Requirement 4: Balanced Readability for Multiple Skill Levels

**User Story:** As a team lead with both junior and intermediate developers, I want documentation that is accessible to beginners but still valuable for experienced developers, so that the entire team can benefit from the same documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN explaining technical concepts THEN the system SHALL provide both simple explanations and technical details
2. WHEN using Spring terminology THEN the system SHALL include brief explanations for complex terms
3. WHEN showing code examples THEN the system SHALL include comments explaining the non-obvious parts
4. WHEN documenting design patterns THEN the system SHALL explain both what the pattern is and why it's used
5. WHEN showing method signatures THEN the system SHALL explain parameter purposes and return value significance

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Method Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer using a class method, I want detailed information about each method including purpose, parameters, return values, and usage examples, so that I can use the method correctly without reading the source code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting each public method THEN the system SHALL include purpose, parameters, return value, and usage example
2. WHEN a method has complex parameters THEN the system SHALL explain each parameter's role and expected format
3. WHEN a method can throw exceptions THEN the system SHALL document common error scenarios
4. WHEN methods are related or form workflows THEN the system SHALL explain the relationships
5. WHEN a method is part of a Spring pattern THEN the system SHALL explain how it fits into the pattern

### Requirement 6: Visual Relationship Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer understanding system architecture, I want visual diagrams showing how the class relates to other classes, so that I can understand the class's role in the larger system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating class documentation THEN the system SHALL include a class relationship diagram using Mermaid
2. WHEN the class has dependencies THEN the system SHALL show dependency relationships visually
3. WHEN the class is part of a Spring layer THEN the system SHALL show its position in the layered architecture
4. WHEN methods call other class methods THEN the system SHALL optionally include method flow diagrams for complex interactions

### Requirement 7: Practical Integration Examples

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with a class, I want to see complete usage scenarios showing how the class works with other parts of the system, so that I can implement proper integration patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the class is a Spring component THEN the system SHALL show how it's typically injected and used
2. WHEN the class interacts with databases THEN the system SHALL show typical transaction patterns
3. WHEN the class handles HTTP requests THEN the system SHALL show request/response examples
4. WHEN the class uses configuration THEN the system SHALL show how configuration affects behavior
5. WHEN the class is part of a workflow THEN the system SHALL show the complete workflow example

### Requirement 8: Enhanced Error Handling and Troubleshooting

**User Story:** As a developer debugging issues, I want documentation that helps me understand common problems and solutions, so that I can resolve issues quickly without extensive investigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN methods can fail THEN the system SHALL document common failure scenarios and solutions
2. WHEN Spring-specific issues can occur THEN the system SHALL mention common Spring pitfalls
3. WHEN configuration affects behavior THEN the system SHALL explain configuration-related issues
4. WHEN the class has performance implications THEN the system SHALL mention optimization considerations
5. WHEN debugging is complex THEN the system SHALL suggest debugging approaches
